# Solving and solving options {#solve}

In general, ODEs are solved using a combination of:

- A compiled model specification from `rxode2()`, specified with
  `object=`

- Input parameters, specified with `params=` (and could be blank)

- Input data or event table, specified with `events=`

- Initial conditions, specified by `inits=` (and possibly in the model
  itself by `state(0)=`)


The solving options are given in the sections below:


## General Solving Options

### rxControl
`rxControl` Input list or rxControl type of list
### sensCmt
`sensCmt` Number of sensitivity compartments
### ncmt
`ncmt` Number of compartments
